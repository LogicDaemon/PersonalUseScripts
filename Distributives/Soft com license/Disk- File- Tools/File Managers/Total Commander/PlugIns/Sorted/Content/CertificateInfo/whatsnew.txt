Version 0.4.0  [2023-09-28]
[+]  Added support for embedded PKCS#7 certificates which
     are used in binary files like EXE, DLL, SYS, CPL, MSI,
     CAB, CAT and so on.
     The detect string returned to TC doesn't contain these
     extensions by default, they need to be added manually
     by the user.
[+]  Added packer interface (WCX).
     The plugin can now be used to extract single
     certificates from certificate files and to convert
     between binary and Base64 formats. See Readme for
     information on how to register it as a packer plugin.
