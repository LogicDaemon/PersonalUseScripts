What's new
* Version 1.3 (01-Feb-2017)

  - Directory structure refurbished: now you can access different parts of device's filesystem via several root folders.
  - Implemented access for user app documents, even on non-jailbroken devices.

* Version 1.2 (27-Jan-2017)

  - All dependencies are now complied into the plugin! This allowed to merge 32- and 64-bit versions together, and also dramatically reduce plugin size.
  - Switch in settings allows to connect as 'mobile' on Jailbroken devices, resolving problems with root ownership of files.
  - Switch in settings enables copying edited versions of photos from DCIM (for those who like editing photos on the phone).

* Version 1.1 (30-Dec-2016)

  - Updated imobiledevice library, iOS 10 is now supported!
  - Reduced size of libraries.
