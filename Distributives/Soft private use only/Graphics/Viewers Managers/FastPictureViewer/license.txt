Volume discounts and site licensing can also be arranged upon request.
Can I obtain a FastPictureViewer Professional trial license to evaluate the pro features?
Yes. The standard installer comes with a trial license if you are a first time user. 

The trial license transforms an installed FastPictureViewer Home Basic edition into a temporary (but fully functional) Professional Edition. At the end of the evaluation period the program simply reverts to the Home Basic edition and continues to work with the Professional features disabled. You can install updates during the evaluation period without affecting the status of your evaluation.

Shall you decide to purchase a full license, you can upgrade to the regular Professional version at any time during or after the evaluation period, simply visit the purchase page to acquire a regular license and enter it in the program's registration form. The electronic store is entirely automated and stays open 7/24, licenses keys are delivered by email.
