 Cogito v1 Preview is a family of hybrid reasoning models by Deep Cogito that outperform the best available open models of the same size, including counterparts from LLaMA, DeepSeek, and Qwen across most standard benchmarks. 
 
 The Cogito v1 Preview LLMs are instruction tuned generative models (text in/text out). All models are released under an open license for commercial use.

    Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
    The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
    The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
        In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
    Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

Extended thinking

To enable extended thinking, include Enable deep thinking subroutine. in the system prompt:

/set system """Enable deep thinking subroutine."""

Or via the API:
